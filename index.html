                        Construction to build our custom home.
                        Kyle was great to work with by giving us options and being attentive to our wishes. It was
                        always
                        easy to discuss items with them as they were very focused on our home. The whole process took
                        about
                        six months which was from plan development to move in. <br><br>We felt they treated the

                        our
                        home as if it was their own. Quality was uppermost in all our minds and we are very pleased
                        with
                        the
                        finished product. They built our home on time, on budget, and high quality. We thank them for a
