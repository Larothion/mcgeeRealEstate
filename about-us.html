                <p class='lead py-2 px-1'>Samuel Stevens & Associates construction was founded by two brothers, Steve and
                    Sam Dougherty. Later another relative (by marriage) joined the clan. Bill Heslin is a retired Air Force
                    Lt. Col., and has been in construction since 1986. Steve is a Real Estate Broker/Associate and contractor.
                    Sam is a former advertising executive and residential contractor. Since our company opened its doors
                    in 2009, we’ve treated every customer like they were a part of our family. Other companies may offer
                    similar services, but our services come with a guarantee and a personal touch!

                <p class='lead py-2 px-1'>When you find the perfect place, you know it. It is more than the right color,
                    a gourmet kitchen, or a crackling fireplace in the living room. It's a feeling that this is the house...
                    the house that was built just for you! ​At Samuel Steven's, we know it is the intangibles that can turn
                    a dream into reality..... something worthy of the largest investment you may ever make. That's why we
                    build every one of our homes with you in mind and we go a step further, by putting your personal touches
                    in your new home, whether it's selecting the flooring, interior paint color or kitchen counter-tops and
                    more. At Samuel Steven's & Associates, Inc., we build your home for you, your way!
